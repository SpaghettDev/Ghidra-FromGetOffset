# Ghidra-FromGetOffset
Gets the offset of an address, or gets the address of an offset

## Installation:
1. Copy `FromGetOffset.py` into GHIDRA_PATH\Ghidra\Features\Python\ghidra_scripts
2. And that's pretty much it

## Launching:
I would recommend setting a key binding to launch the script. </br>
To do that;
1. Click on the window tab in the top left of the CodeBrowser
2. Click on the Script Manager (4th to last option)
3. Click on the filter text box and type "FromGetOffset"
4. Right Click on the script and select "Assign Key Binding"
5. Enter the key binding of your choice (I set it as SHIFT+F)
6. Then click on "Ok"

Now whenever you want to open the FromGetOffset extention, click on a line in the listing tab, then enter the key binding chosen earlier, and choose what you want to do.
